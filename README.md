# Neighborhood Map
===============================
## Synopsis
Shows you locaions in New York city around Time Square. Uses Google Maps, FourSquare to filter and display places on the map.

## Requirements
Dependent on both Google Maps and FourSquare. If any issues reported, ensure both have a valid API key. Project is built with react and controlled with yarn. After first download run yarn install to get all the dependencies. yarn start to run the project.

### Service Worker
In order get to the service worker working, it must be built in production mode. Run yarn build. Once the project builds successfully, you'll need to run a webserver pointed at the /build directory to see the service worker in action. I recommend using the Google Chrome Dev Server extension.
